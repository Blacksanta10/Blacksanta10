        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <article>
            <p>
                I have been watching anime for about 10 years now.
                I wanted to start reading the manga because there were <em>LOTS</em> of anime that we stopped short or bad.
                I now have a finacial situation that allows me start collecting and reading! I am honestly super excited about it.
                Right now this website is going to be used to document my journey with manga. As time goes on I will add things concerning anime too!

        <h2>Manga Series starting</h2>
        <article>
            <p>
                I am starting to read a combination of manga that does and doesn't have anime. Here they are.

            <li>
                <h3 id="manga">Rosario and vampire</h3>
                <p>This is one of the first anime adaptation I watched. I am excited to read this, because I heard it went on a bit longer than the anime.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3 id="manga">Banana Fish</h3>
                <p>This does not have an anime adaptation! I found this interesting story through the Vizmedia website. I believe the genre consists of mystery, which is a nice change for me.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <h3 id="manga">Demon slayer</h3>
                <p>I watched the first season and the recent movie of demon slayer. After I watched the movie I was overly excited about the upcoming seasons. I decided I did not want to wait though, so I am jumping right into the manga starting after the Mugen train.</p>

        <h2>Manga series want-to-read list</h2>
        <h3>Soul eater</h3>
        <p>I loved the Soul eater anime adaptation! It's been many years since I watched it. I read that the character dynamics were a bit different and there were things left behind that are in the manga.</p>
        <h3>Toyko Ghoul</h3>
        <p>I tried to watch the toyko ghoul anime, but my reliable friend always told me how it screwed up big time later on. I enjoy the concept of the story and to read it would make it worth my time.</p>
